The Country Filter Web Application is a frontend project that allows users to interact with a list of countries, filter them by region, or search them by name. The app also includes features like a responsive design, an intuitive search bar, and an easy-to-use filter dropdown.

This project was developed to demonstrate the use of JavaScript for dynamically interacting with data, along with some basic UI/UX principles to ensure the app is user-friendly.

Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive, ensuring that it works well on devices of all screen sizes.
Clear Filters: Users can clear the search input field and reset any filters they have applied.
Go Back Functionality: After filtering the countries, users can easily go back to the full list of countries by clicking a "Go Back" button, which will reset the search field and the filters.

How to Use:-
Once the application is open in your browser, follow these steps:

Search for a Country:

Type the name of a country in the search bar at the top of the page.
The list of countries will dynamically filter and display matching results as you type.
Filter by Region:

Select a region (e.g., Africa, Asia, Europe) from the dropdown list.
The countries will be filtered according to the selected region, and the list will update automatically.
Go Back to Full List:

After filtering the countries by name or region, click the "Go Back" button to return to the full list of countries.
This will clear both the search input field and the region filter, resetting the view to show all countries.
Clear Filters:

You can manually clear the search input or reset the dropdown filter to see all countries again.
